AKKA CONCURRENCY SAMPLES
------------------------

1. INTRODUCTION

The concurrency samples are designed to illustrate solving problems using concurrency.  It should be possible to illustrate several different problem domains.  The samples are somewhat contrived to keep them simple, but they should help to illustrate the flexibility of Akka in solving different types of problem.


2. SAMPLES

The samples include:

* a simple example of brewing beer using a genetic algorithm
